# Parsing-In-Python

This code parses an XML file, extracts data for each book, and writes the data to a CSV file.
The code first imports the ‘xml.etree.ElementTree’ and ‘csv modules’, which are used to parse the XML file and write the data to the CSV file, respectively.
Next, the code starts a ‘try’ block to catch any exceptions that may be raised. Inside the ‘try’ block, the XML file is parsed using the ET.parse() function and the root element is retrieved using the getroot() method.
Then, the CSV file is opened in write mode using the open() function. The csv.writer() function is used to create a CSV writer, which is used to write the data to the file.
The header row is written to the file using the writerow() method, and then a loop iterates over all the book elements in the XML file. For each book, the data is extracted and written to a row in the CSV file using the writerow() method.
Finally, the code has an except block to catch any exceptions that may be raised during the execution of the try block. If an exception is caught, a message is printed to the console. This can be helpful for debugging if there is an issue with the code.
